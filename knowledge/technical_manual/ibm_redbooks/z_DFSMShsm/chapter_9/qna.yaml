      DFSMShsm auto migration processing was performed in three major serialized
      steps: A preprocessing
      step that checks eligibility, enqueues for serialization, and updates the
      CDS and catalog A data
      movement step, which can be class transition (moving data between ML0
      tiers) or a migration
      hierarchy movement (Ml0 to Ml1 or ML2) A postprocessing step that performs
      the dequeue, the
      updates to the CDS and catalog, and scratch cleanup For small data sets,
      the overhead of
      premigration and postmigration processing is two/thirds of the total
      processing time.

      You can activate Interval migration either by a PARMLIB setting in the
      ARCCMDxx member or by using
      the 'SETSYS INTERVALMIGRATION' parameter. Defining interval migration in
      PARMLIB requires you either
      to restart DFSMShsm or to execute the command. A QUERY SETSYS command
      informs you whether interval
      migration is active. In addition to the SETSYS activation, you also must
      set the eligibility requirements.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm space management, how to
      enable interval migration?
  - answer: >
      Migration of non-SMS-managed VSAM data sets occurs at the sphere level.
      The base cluster and index
      do not need to be defined individually. PATHs are also included
      automatically. When DFSMShsm
      migrates a VSAM sphere, it tracks up to eight components for one data set.
      For a non-SMS-managed
      component, only the components that reside in one volume can be migrated.
      DFSMShsm will no
      migrate VSAM data sets with a component that needs verification. A VSAM
      data set with more than
      one alternate index or path will not be selected for automigration.
      DFSMShsm will not migrate a
      data set that is marked as “forward recovery”. After the migration of the
      non-SMS-managed volumes,
      DFSMShsm performs extent reduction in the same manner that it performs
      extent reduction for SMS-managed data sets.

      Elaborate on space management for VSAM data sets ?

      You activate migration subtasking through the SETSYS command only in the
      DFSMShsm startup member.
      You cannot dynamically activate migration subtasking through a 'SETSYS'
      command. The following example shows how migration subtasking
      is activated:
      'SETSYS MIGRATIONSUBTASKS(YES)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm space management, is it
      possible to  dynamically
      activate migration subtasking through a 'SETSYS' command?
  - answer: >
      DFSMS V2.1 introduced a significant throughput improvement in auto
      migration by enabling multiple migration subtasks that run in parallel
      under each migration task. This new function, which iscalled migration subtasking,
      increases bandwidth in auto migration and offers new possibilities for
      managing migration requirements.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, what is migration
      subtasking in the context of DFSMS?
  - answer: >
      You can disable the FSM function by issuing the 'SETSYS TAPEMIGRATION
      RECONNECT(NONE)' command or by adding the same command in the ARCCMDxx
      member in SYS1.PARMLIB. DFSMShsm must be restarted

      Subsequent Migration feature of  DFSMShsm?
