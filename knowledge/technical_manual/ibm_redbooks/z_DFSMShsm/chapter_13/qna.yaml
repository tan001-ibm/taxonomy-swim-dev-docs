      QUERY command asks the DFSMShsm address space for the requested
      information. Therefore, you cannot use the QUERY command to request
       information about CDS records and you cannot use the
      'LIST' command for address space inquires.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, what is the difference
      between 'LIST' and 'QUERY' commands in DFSMShsm regarding CDS records and
      address space inquiries?

      To list the backup volumes that are assigned to DFSMShsm, you can issue
      the following command:
      'HSEND LIST BACKUPVOLUME ODS(MHLRES5.LBV)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, how to list  backup
      volumes that are assigned to DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      A simple way to list all of the dump classes that are defined to DFSMShsm
      is by issuing a 'LIST DUMPCLASS' command. If you already know the dump
      class name, you can put the dump class name in parentheses, and DFSMShsm
      will display information about the specific dump class only. The following
      command lists all dump classes that are defined to DFSMShsm:
      'HSEND LIST DUMPCLASS ODS(MHLRES7.DSN1)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, how does the LIST
      DUMPCLASS command work in DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      In certain cases, the standard reports and lists from DFSMShsm do not
      provide the necessaryvinformation for the storage manager to determine
      DFSMShsm usage or to create reports with specific information about data
      sets, such as the creation date or the number of data sets that were
      migrated by using a specific management class. To create these reports,
      you can use the DFSMSrmm report generator
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, explain the significance
      of  DFSMSrmm report generator.

      With DCOLLECT, you can obtain information about the following features:
      - Active data sets
      - Volumes
      - Migrated data sets
      - Backup data sets
      - DASD capacity planning
      - Tape capacity planning
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, list some features whose
      information can be obtained using DCOLLECT.
  - answer: >
      If you need a list of all of the data sets that are stored in a specific
      volume when it was dumped, you can use the following command. You need to
      provide the dump volume name, and the  source volume that you want to list.
      If you do not enter a source volume, DFSMShsm will list the volumes that
      are recorded on that tape. The following command lists the content of SB0XJ0
      on the THS019 dump tape:
      'HSEND LIST DUMPVOLUME(THS019) DCONTENTS(SBOXJO) ODS('MHLRES7.DSN1')'

      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, how to get  a list of
      all of the data sets that are stored in a specific volume when it was dumped?
