      Shared Control Data Sets (SHCDSs) are linear data sets that contain
      information to allow processing if a system failure might affect RLS.
      They also act as logs for sharing support.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm control data sets (CDSs),
      define Shared Control Data Sets SHCDSs.

      The easiest way to remove keyrange CDSs is to remove the KEYRANGE((...))
      parameter from the IDCAMS DEFINE DATA statements that you used to define
      your CDSs as keyrange. During startup, DFSMShsm dynamically calculates the key
      boundaries for each cluster. You can then use the 'QUERY CONTROLDATASETS' command
      to display both the low and high keys that DFSMShsm calculates for each
      cluster. If your CDSs are defined with keyranges, you can perform a CDS
      reorganization, and remove the KEYRANGE parameter from the DEFINE command.

      The BCDS is responsible for storing backup information for every data set
      that is managed and backed up by DFSMShsm on either on DASD or tape. It also
      records information about aggregate backup and recovery support (ABARS) data
      sets, dumps, and fast recovery backups. Every time a recover is issued for
      any of these functions, DFSMShsm uses BCDS information to process the
      request. If BCDS is not allocated, DFSMShsm is not able to perform ABARS,
      backups, dumps, or fast recovery backup-related tasks. You will not be able
      to recover the data from any existing backups that are controlled by DFSMShsm
       if the BCDS is lost.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm control data sets (CDSs),
      elaborate on  backup control data set (BCDS)
  - answer: >
      Before CDSs can be accessed in RLS mode, you must define or alter them to
      be RLS-eligible, by using the LOG(NONE) attribute. You must define or alter
      them to be RLS-eligible for all your CDSs (MCDSs, BCDSs, and OCDSs).
      The following example shows how to use the IDCAMS ALTER command to make
      the CDSs that we previously defined RLS-eligible: 'ALTER HSM.MCDS LOG(NONE)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm control data sets (CDSs),
      how to make CDSs RLS-eligible?
  - answer: >
      DFSMShsm requires a minimum of one CDS, a maximum of three CDSs, and one
      journal data set.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm control data sets (CDSs),
      how many CDSs are required by DFSMShsm along with the journal data set?
  - answer: >
      To use Concurrent Copy for CDS backup, you must perform the following
      tasks:

      - Allocate the CDSs on system-managed volumes that are attached to DASD
      subsystems that have Concurrent Copy available

      - Ensure that the CDSs receive a management class as described next

      - Specify that DFSMShsm will use DFSMSdss as the data mover
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm control data sets (CDSs),
      what all tasks must be performed to use concurrent copy for CDS backup?
