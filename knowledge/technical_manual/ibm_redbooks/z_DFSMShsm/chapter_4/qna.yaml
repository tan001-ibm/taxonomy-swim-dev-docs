- answer: |
        In DFSMShsm environment data can be divided into three types as follows:

        1.Data that is managed by DFSMShsm:
        This group includes all of the user and application data that DFSMShsm manages according to
        the parameters that are coded in the SMS management classes. Certain DFSMShsm system data
        sets are also included in this group.

        2.Data that is owned by DFSMShsm:
        User data that is now on DFSMShsm-owned volumes, for example, migration level 2 (ML2) data
        or backup copies. The data in this group belongs to DFSMShsm. SMS must be updated so that it
        recognizes the DFSMShsm data and excludes it from SMS management.

        3.DFSMShsm control data:
        Data, such as control data sets (CDSs) that are required for the operation of DFSMShsm.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, how can data be divided in a DFSMShsm environment?
- answer: |
        The storage group specifications determine only how DFSMShsm automated processing processes
        the volume. They have no impact on how commands that are directed to the volume or against
        data sets that are allocated on the volume are processed.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is the need of storage group specification?
- answer: |
        Folowing DFSMShsm functions are managed at a storage group level:

        1.Space management.

        2.Availability management:
          a.Automatic backup processing.
          b.Automatic dump processing.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what are the DFSMShsm functions are managed at a
        storage group level?
- answer: |
        Thresholds are applied as a percentage of the space for each volume so where storage groups consist of volumes
        of different capacities, thresholds are applied according to each volumes capacity.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is Threshold in Space management of DFSMShsm?
- answer: |
        1 is the default value of low allocated threshold.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is the default value of low allocated threshold?
- answer: |
        Names in fixed formats can be used as filters in ACS routines to control the allocation of data sets in
        a DFSMShsm environment.
  question: |
        How can names in fixed formats be used in a DFSMShsm environment?
- answer: |
        Example: 'FILTLIST &HSM_CONTROL_DATA INCLUDE(HSM.%CDS.*,HSM.JRNL.* INCLUDE(HSM.%CDS.*,HSM.JRNL.*)'
  question: |
        Provide an example of a sample ACS filter for DFSMShsm CDSs.
- answer: |
        The three ACS environments are ALLOC, RECALL, and RECOVER.
  question: |
        What are the three ACS environments that need to be considered for DFSMShsm data management?
