        The automatic backup function, which is also referred to as incremental backup, ensures that current
        copies of new and changed data sets exist in case the original data sets are damaged or accidentally
        deleted. The automatic incremental backup function is a data-set-level function when DFSMShsm is
        processing level 0 volumes or a level 1 migration volume to a backup volume during the automatic backup window.
  question: |
        What is the purpose of the automatic backup function in DFSMShsm, and how does it ensure data availability?
- answer: |
        For DFSMShsm to perform automatic backup, you must set up automatic backup requirements for both the
        DFSMShsm environment and the data set level.
  question: |
        What setup is required for DFSMShsm to perform automatic backups?
- answer: |
        Use following command is used to back up an individual data set in DFSMShsm:

        command: '(H)BACKDS dsname | dsn_patterns'
  question: |
        Which data set backup command is used to back up an individual data set in DFSMShsm?
- answer: |
        The data set backup by command function provides the following capabilities:

        1.Up to 64 data sets for each host can be backed up at one time.

        2.Data sets can be backed up directly to DASD or to tape.

        3.If Concurrent Copy is specified, users are notified when the data set backup is either logically
        or physically complete. In addition, Concurrent Copy supports non-SMS data sets, or if specified on
        the command, Concurrent Copy overrides the management class for an SMS data set.

        4.Users can unmount continuously mounted backup tapes.

        5.Users can tailor the times when DFSMShsm unmounts a tape.

        6.Users can specify the number of days to retain a specific backup copy of a data set. See 10.1.4,
        “Backing up a data set manually and the RETAINDAYS keyword” on page 257.

        7.Users can create a data set backup copy and store it under a different, specified data set name.
  question: |
        What capabilities does the data set backup by command function in DFSMShsm provide?
- answer: |
        You can use automatic backup for data sets on non-SMS-managed volumes by using the 'ADDVOL' command
        and defining it in the 'ARCCMDxx' member. The syntax is:

        command:'ADDVOL volser UNIT(unittype) PRIMARY(AUTOBACKUP)'
  question: |
        How can you use automatic backup for data sets on non-SMS-managed volumes in DFSMShsm?
- answer: |
        The frequency of data set backups for non-SMS-managed storage is defined using the 'FREQUENCY'
        parameter of the 'SETSYS' command. This parameter controls the backup frequency for the data
        sets processed by each DFSMShsm host. The command to add to the 'ARCCMDxx' member for each host is:

        command: 'SETSYS FREQUENCY(days)'
  question: |
        How do you define the frequency of data set backups for non-SMS-managed storage in DFSMShsm?
- answer: |
        The process of fast data replication occurs so fast because it builds a map, with pointers,
        to the source volume tracks or extents. You no longer need to wait for the physical copy to
        complete before applications can resume the access to the data. Both the source and target
        data are available for read/write access almost immediately, while the copy process
        continues in the background. This process guarantees that the contents of the target volume
        are an exact duplicate of the source volume at that point in time.
  question: |
        What is the purpose of the fast replication function in DFSMShsm, and how does it work?
