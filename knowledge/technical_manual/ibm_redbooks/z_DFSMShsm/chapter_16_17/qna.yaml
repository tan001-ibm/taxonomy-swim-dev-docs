      If you are experiencing difficulty finding space to recall a large data
      set, you have two options.

      You can force it to go multivolume:
      'HSEND RECALL datasetname DFDSSOPTION(VOLCOUNT(ANY))'

       Or, you can direct it to an empty, non-SMS disk:
      'HSEND RECALL datasetname FORCENONSMS UNIT(3390) VOLUME(nonSMSvol)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm, how can you manage
      space constraints when
      recalling a large dataset in DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      If the ML1 pool is full, consider adding more volumes to the
      migration-level 1 (ML1) pool, empty
      out older data, or move out the larger files. The following command will
      move data that is one day
      old or older on ML1 to ML2: 'MIGRATE MIGRATIONLEVEL1 DAYS(1)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm, how to deal with a full
      ML1 pool
  - answer: >
      Specify 0M for SIZE, which directs DFSMShsm to allocate the largest
      possible region size. This
      specification reduces the chance that DFSMShsm will end abnormally because
      of an out-of-space condition (ABEND878).
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm, what is the
      significance of assigning REGION=0M when you start DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      The term Tape Take Away in DFSMShsm is used to cover the situation where a
      long-running function
      is preventing a request from being processed, for example, an ML2 recall
      from being processed
      because the tape request for the recall is used by a long-running
      function. Tape Take Away can be
      requested by the recall function, and Tape Take Away occurs fast and
      smoothly. (The tape is released for the recall.)
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm,  briefly descibe Tape
      Take Away in DFSMShsm.

      You can alter the priority of the following request types:
      ABACKUP
      ARECOVER
      BACKDS
      BACKVOL
      DELETE
      FRBACKUP
      FREEVOL
      FRRECOV
      MIGRATE
      RECALL
      RECOVER
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm, list the request types
      whose priority can be altered using  ALTERPRI command
  - answer: >
      The PATCH command changes storage within the DFSMShsm address space. You
      can identify the storagelocation to change with an absolute address or a qualified address.
      For sites with unique requirements of DFSMShsm that are not supported by existing DFSMShsm
      commands and parameters,these tuning patches might offer a solution. In cases
      where the unique requirements remain the same from day to day, you might choose to include
      the patches in the DFSMShsm startup member.These DFSMSShsm-supported patches
      remain supported from release to release without modification.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with  DFSMShsm, explain the
      significance of PATCH command in DFSMShsm
task_description: >-
  In this chapter, we provide useful hints and tips, and recommend the preferred
  practices for implementing DFSMShsm and the daily administration of DFSMShsm
  and  describe functions that are common to multiple areas of DFSMShsm, which
  allows us to document these functions in one place only.
