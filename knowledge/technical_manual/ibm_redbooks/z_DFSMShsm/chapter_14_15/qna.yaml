        The most important sources of problem determination documentation for DFSMShsm are:

        1.Problem Determination Aid (PDA)

        2.DFSMShsm dumps

        3.SYSLOG

        4.JOBLOG

        5.Activity logs
  question: |
        What are the most important sources of problem determination documentation for DFSMShsm?
- answer: |
        Message indicates that the attempted migration of data set DERDMANN.MIGTST failed with an RC19,
        REAS=0001 and that the ARC1219I message must be referenced to determine the meaning of the RC19.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, explain the following output of an ARC1001I message:
          'ARC1001I DERDMANN.MIGTST MIGRATE FAILED, RC=0019, REAS=0001'
          'ARC1219I DATA SET IN USE BY ANOTHER USER OR JOB, MIGRATION REJECTED'
- answer: |
        The AUDIT command should be used in the following situations:

        • After any CDS restore (highly recommended)

        • After receiving an ARC184I message (error when reading or writing DFSMShsm CDS records)

        • Errors on the RECALL or DELETE of migrated data sets

        • Errors on BDELETE or RECOVER of backup data sets

        • DFSMShsm tape-selection problems

        • RACF authorization failures

        • Power or hardware failure

        • Consistency checking of fast replication CDS record relationships

        • Periodic checks
  question: |
        When should the AUDIT command be used?
- answer: |
        The IBM Health Checker examines the health of selected system components at regular intervals. It monitors
        settings, looks for single points of failure in the setup, and issues warnings that are based on its findings
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is the purpose of the IBM Health Checker function?
- answer: |
        Operate the Health Checker by using the following commands:

        1.Start health checker
          command: 'S hzsproc'

        2.Run a group of health checks
          command: 'F hzsproc,RUN,CHECK=(ibmhsm,*)'

        3.Run individ. health check
          command: 'F hzsproc,RUN,CHECK=(ibmsms,sms_cds_reuse_option)'

        4.Update
          command: 'F hzsproc,UPDATE,CHECK=(ibmsms,sms_cds_reuse_option),severity=(med)'
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, how can you operate the Health Checker by command?
- answer: |
        The following messages might be displayed in the DMO_TAPE_LIBRARY_INIT_ERRORS health check report:

        1.DMOH0101I: Indicates that the check ran successfully and found no exceptions.

        2.DMOH0102I: Displays additional text (specific content not provided in the example).

        3.DMOH0104E: Indicates that the check determined that library device initialization errors occurred during IPL.

        4.DMOH0105I: Indicates that the check is not applicable in the current environment because there are no tape
        libraries defined.
  question: |
        As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what messages might be displayed in the
        DMO_TAPE_LIBRARY_INIT_ERRORS health check report, and what do they indicate?
