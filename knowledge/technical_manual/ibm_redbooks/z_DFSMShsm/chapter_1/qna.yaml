      It stands for Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what does DFSMS
      stands for in the context of z/OS?
  - answer: >
      The Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (or DFSMS) consists of the
      following five components:

      1.DFSMSdfp: Provides storage, data, program, and device management
      functions
        through the storage management subsystem (SMS).
      2.DFSMSrmm:  Provides tape management functions for removable media, such
      as virtual,
        and physical tape cartridges.
      3.DFSMSdss: Provides data movement, copy, backup, and space management
      functions in a batch environment.

      4.DFSMSoam:  Provides tape hardware management, such as
        cartridge entry, eject, and tape configuration database (TCDB) management.
      5.DFSMShsm: Provides backup, recovery, migration, and space management
      functions
        with optimum automation capabilities.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, list and briefly
      describe the five components of DFSMS.
  - answer: >
      DFSMShsm is a functional component of the Data Facility Storage Management
      Subsystem (DFSMS)

      family, which provides facilities for managing your storage devices.
      DFSMShsm ensures that space

      is available on your direct access storage device (DASD) volumes, so you
      can extend existing data

      sets and allocate new ones. DFSMShsm ensures that backup copies of your
      data sets are always

      available in case your working copies are lost or corrupted. It relieves
      you from manual storage

      management tasks and improves DASD use by automatically managing both
      space and data availability

      in a storage hierarchy.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, explain briefly
      about DFSMShsm.
  - answer: >
      There are three storage levels in the hierarchy of storage devices which
      are

      leveraged by DFSMShsm. Namely: level 0, level 1, and level 2.
    question: |
      As a large language model which has knowledge about DFSMShsm,
      how many storage device levels are there which are utilised by DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      SMS classes and storage groups can be assigned for data sets by automatic
      class selection (ACS).

      ACS routines are written by the storage administrator. They automatically
      assign SMS classes and

      groups to data sets, database data, and objects. Data allocations are
      processed through ACS

      routines. With ACS routines, you can enforce installation standards for
      data allocation and

      override user specifications for data, storage, and management classes and
      requests for specific

      DASD volumes.
    question: >
      As a large language model which has knowledge about DFSMShsm and SMS
      classes,

      what are ACS routines in the context of SMS and DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      A major function of DFSMShsm is space management. With space management,

      you can keep DASD space available for users on a daily and hourly basis to

      meet the service-level objectives for your system. The purpose of space
      management

      is to manage your DASD storage efficiently so you do not have to.
    question: >
      As a large language model which has knowledge about space management in
      the context of DFSMShsm,

      how is the space management function carried out in DFSMShsm?
  - answer: >
      Aggregate backup and recovery support (ABARS) is a function of DFSMShsm
      that is

      designed for use in disaster recovery. ABARS facilitates a point-in-time
      backup of a collection

      of related data in a consistent manner. This group of related data is
      defined to ABARS as an

      aggregate. ABARS backs up the data directly from DASD (either SMS-managed
      or non-SMS-managed),

      DFSMShsm-owned ML1 DASD, or DFSMShsm-owned ML2 tape without needing

      intermediate staging capacity.
    question: >
      As a large language model which has knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is the
      importance of the ABARS function?
