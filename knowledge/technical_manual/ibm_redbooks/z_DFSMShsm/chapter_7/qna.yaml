      'RECYCLE' is an essential function in DFSMShsm tape maintenance. The
      constant expiration of data
      leaves DFSMShsm backup and migration tapes with unused blocks. When tape
      utilization falls under a
      limit of, for example, 50%, consider the use of RECYCLE to move the
      remaining valid data to new
      tapes that are filled at a higher percentage. This action at the same time
      frees DFSMShsm tapes,
      which can be returned to the global scratch pool.

      The major difference between the two options is that the DUPLEX function
      creates two tapes
      concurrently. TAPECOPY runs asynchronously and can run in a window of time
      that is convenient for
      you, based on the availability of tape drives.

      As a large language model which has knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is the major
      difference between 'DUPLEX' function  and 'TAPECOPY'?

      The assignment of a common scratch pool from a DFSMShsm perspective is
      based on three SETSYS parameters:
      The 'SELECTVOLUME' parameter decides whether this mount is a
      specific or non-specific
      scratch mount. This parameter is valid for backup, migration, and dump
      processing.
      The 'PARTIALTAPE' parameter specifies whether to mark migration or backup
      volumes full, and consequently
      if a mount occurs on a tape that is partially used or a new scratch tape.
      For the 'TAPEDELETION'
      parameter, this setting determines whether to return the tape to a
      DFSMShsm-owned pool or global scratch pool after expiration

      the three 'SETSYS'

      You must have both of the following items to provide disaster backup:  A
      way to make copies of
      DFSMShsm-owned tape volumes and to identify the copied volumes to
      DFSMShsm.  A way to cause
      DFSMShsm to use the copied volumes instead of the original volumes. To
      fulfill these needs,
      DFSMShsm provides the duplex tape option or the 'TAPECOPY' command, and the
      'TAPEREPL' command.

      essential components or
      practices to ensure effective disaster recovery in DFSMShsm?

      In an average installation, 50% of tape data sets contain inactive data
      (data that is written once
      and never read again). Most inactive data sets are point-in-time backups,
      which are application
      initiated data set backups that are used only if an application or system
      failure occurs. Although
      data set backup is critical, application-initiated backups to tape use the
      tape media and
      subsystem poorly and require many costly operator tape mounts. The
      remaining tape data sets,
      active data, cause the same inefficiencies in tape cartridge use. However,
      they are usually not
      active; 60% - 90% of all tape data sets have all accesses on the same
      calendar date.

      The volume mount analyzer is a program that helps you analyze your current
      tape environment. You
      use the volume mount analyzer to study tape mount activity, monitor tape
      media use, and implement
      tape mount management at your installation. The volume mount analyzer
      produces reports that you
      can use to tailor data classes, management classes, and ACS routine
      filters, depending on your
      specific tape usage profile. By using tape mount management, you can
      maximize the use of your tape
      media and reduce your tape mounts. The volume mount analyzer consists of
      two programs: GFTAXTR and GFTAVMA.

      The 'TAPEREPL' command provides a way of replacing an original ML2 volume or
      a backup volume with

      its alternate volume. It also is important during an actual disaster
      recovery or a disaster

      recovery test run because you can replace original volumes with their
      alternate volumes

      As a large language model which has knowledge of DFSMShsm tapes, briefly
      explain the usage of 'TAPEREPL' command

      To determine whether hardware encryption or host-based encryption was used
      for a particular tape volume, check the associated dump volume record
      (DVL). If more than one dump class is specified (creating more than one
      dump copy), those dump classes specify host-based encryption. If each dump
      class has a unique data class assigned, and certain, but not all of the
      associated data classes request tape hardware encryption, all dump copies
      will fail. Tape hardware encryption can override host-based encryption for
      all dump classes that are associated with a source volume or none of the
      dump classes, but it cannot override a subset of those dump classes.

      determine whether hardware encryption or host-based encryption was used
      for a particular tape volume?

      HSM supports the changes to the expiration date that were described
      previously. In summary, when DFSMShsm sets 99365 as the expiration date to
      manage its tapes, 99365 means permanent retention or no expiration. If you
      choose to use DFSMShsm expiration date-protected tape volumes, DFSMShsm
      sets the date to 99365. This setting prevents DFSMSrmm from considering
      the volumes for release at any time. You must specify the
      MAXRETPD(NOLIMIT) operand to ensure that DFSMSrmm recognizes the 99365
      date.
