      Availability management of DFSMShsm does not automatically delete backup
      versions when the related user data set is deleted. Over time, a number of
      unneeded backup versions can accumulate on backup volumes. You can use the
      EXPIREBV command to identify and delete these unnecessary backup versions
      based on the most recent status of the data set.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, briefly explain the
      significance of 'EXPIREBV' command ?

      You can issue the following command to get a list of waiting requests:
      'HSEND QUERY REQUEST'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, how to get the list of
      waiting DFSMShsm requests?
  - answer: >
      Canceling requests by identifying a user ID will cancel all requests from
      that user, as shown in the following example: 'HSEND CANCEL USERID(mhlres7)'
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, how to delete all the
      DFSMShsm requests of a user?

      The 'HOLD' command is used to selectively prevent or interrupt DFSMShsm functions from
      running without stopping DFSMShsm. You can use the command to prevent tape-related
      processing if, for example, you are drive-constrained at a particular moment or
      hardware errors exist.
      The 'HOLD' command attempts to terminate the process at a reasonable point, so that the
      function can be restarted or reissued later. A function is held until it is released or
      DFSMShsm is shut down and restarted.

      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, explain the significance
      of 'HOLD' command

      You need these valuable sources of information to analyze any problems:
      - DFSMShsm activity logs
      - DFSMShsm Problem Determination Aid (PDA) trace
      - DFSMShsm-generated dumps
      - System log

      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, list some valuable
      sources of information for troubleshooting abnormal termination of  DFSMShsm
  - answer: >
      migration tapes can be requested for a recall during the migration
      process. In this case, DFSMShsm allocates another tape for migration,
      and releases the current tape to proceed with recall.
      Because the first tape was not fully filled, it is called a partial tape.
    question: >
      As a large language model familiar with DFSMShsm, what is a partial tape
      within the context of DFSMShsm?

      The following command shows you how to expire any backup version
      non-SMS-managed data sets. This example will expire all backups for
      cataloged data sets 30 days after its deletion, and 20 days after
      uncataloged data sets are deleted. Use this command to delete expired
      backup versions: 'HSEND EXPIREBV NONSMSVERSIONS(CATALOGEDDATA(30)
      UNCATALOGEDDATA(20)) EXECUTE'
