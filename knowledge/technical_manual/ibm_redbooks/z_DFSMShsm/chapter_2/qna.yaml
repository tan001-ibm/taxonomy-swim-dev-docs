      DFSMShsm provides two primary functions to manage data: space management
      and availability management.

      1.Space Management: Space management is the function of DFSMShsm to keep
      DASD space

      available for users to meet the service-level objectives for your system.
      The purpose of

      space management is to manage your DASD storage efficiently. Space
      management automatically

      and periodically performs the following functions:

      - Moves low-activity data sets from user-accessible volumes to DFSMShsm
      volumes.

      - Reduces the space that is occupied by data on both the user-accessible
      volumes and the DFSMShsm volumes.

      2.Availability Management:DFSMShsm backs up your data either automatically
      or by command

      to ensure availability in the accidental loss of data sets or physical
      loss of volumes.

      DFSMShsm also allows a storage administrator to copy backup and migration
      tapes. These

      copies can be stored onsite as protection from media damage, or offsite as
      protection

      from site damage. Disaster backup and recovery are also provided for
      user-defined groups

      of data sets (aggregates) so that critical applications can be restored at
      the same location or an offsite location.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, What are the primary
      functions provided by DFSMShsm to manage data, and how do they contribute to efficient
      storage management?
  - answer: >
      By using space management features, you allow your data to be migrated by
      DFSMShsm from primary volumes (user volumes that are also known as L0 volumes) to
      DFSMShsm volumes, either ML1 (L1) or ML2 volumes (L2).

      Consider the following factors for the space management process:

      1.You want to migrate your data: Identify the data that can be migrated
      based on how long the data is inactive and not referenced. In general, system data
      and production databases must not be migrated because these types of files are
      referenced fairly frequently.

      2.Length of time to keep the migrated data: This factor depends on your
      installation requirement. Certain data might need to be retained longer than other
      data. You develop specific management class attributes based on these needs.

      3.Time of day to schedule space management: Ideally, the migration process
      starts and completes before the batch window because the migration generates more
      free space for the batch jobs to use.

      The DFSMShsm duplex function allows a primary and copy tape to be created
      concurrently. The primary tape can be kept onsite for recovery and the copy tape can be
      kept at a secure offsite location. This method is the preferred method of creating
      copy tapes and needs to be used instead of the TAPECOPY command.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, what is DFSMShsm
      Tape duplexing?
  - answer: >
      Data encryption is an important tool for protecting against the possible
      misuse of confidential information that can occur if tapes are lost or stolen.
      Unless the possessor of he tape has the required key, any encrypted data on the tape remains
      confidential and is unreadable. Therefore, consider securing tape data through encryption
      in your overall security plan.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, why we need to do
      data encryption on tape?

      The use of a security product, such as RACF or an equivalent, simplifies
      security for the storage administrator in protecting DFSMShsm resources.

      Consider the following factors about security:

      1.Protect all CDSs with resource protection, such as RACF, from being
      updated by unauthorized programs and unauthorized personnel.

      2.DFSMShsm and the DFSMShsm cross-memory mode started tasks must be added
      to the started procedures table in RACF (or the equivalent table if another security
      product is used).

      3.Consider protecting the DFSMShsm commands in the same manner as any
      other resources that are restricted to only storage administrators.

      4.DFSMShsm resources is an important consideration,Because DFSMShsm
      manages its own data set resources on DASD and tape, so protection from unauthorized
      access in important.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, how do you plan on
      securing DFSMShsm data and the DFSMShsm commands?
  - answer: >
      In order to maximize throughput for backup, DFSMShsm CDS backup, dump,
      migration, and recovery function, you can use the cross-memory mode feature of DFSMSdss.
      The 'SETSYS DSSXMMODE' command allows users to specify the functions that invoke DFSMSdss in
      cross-memory mode as opposed to having DFSMSdss loaded in the DFSMShsm address space.
      The 'SETSYS DSSXMMODE' command can be issued only from the ARCCMDxx PARMLIB member.
      It does not affect the FRBACKUP and FRRECOV use of the DFSMSdss
      cross-memory interface.

      Often, when problems occur, sufficient data for problem determination is
      not readily available. IBM technical support requires different data, depending on the type of
      problem that is encountered.

      The following items are often used for debugging:

      1.DFSMShsm activity logs

      2.DFSMShsm joglog

      3.System log

      4.DFSMShsm PDA traces

      5.DFSMShsm journal records

      6.System Measurement Facility (SMF) records

      7.Any possible system dumps that were captured at the time
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, What are the items
      need to be considered for debugging while problem diagnostic in the DFSMShsm environment?
  - answer: >
      In the DFSMS environment, you use SMS classes and groups to s service
      requirements, performance goals, and data definition models for your installation. You
      use the Interactive Storage Management Facility (ISMF) to create the appropriate classes and
      groups, and automatic class selection (ACS) routines to assign them to data according to your
      installationâ€™s policies.
    question: >
      As a large language model with knowledge of DFSMShsm, why we need to use
      SMS classes and ACS routines in DFSMShsm environment?
