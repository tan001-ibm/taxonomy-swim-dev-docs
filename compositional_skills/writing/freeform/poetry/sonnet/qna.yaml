- answer: 'In autumn''s grand and regal tapestry,

    Where vibrant hues in splendor are unfurled.

    Amber and scarlet leaves, a symphony,

    In nature''s palette, they twirl and twirl.


    Beneath the cerulean sky they sway,

    A festival of color, a visual feast.

    Where crimson leaves like embers lay,

    And gold illuminates the woodland''s least.


    The rustling whispers of the trees'' goodbye,

    A farewell ode to summer''s gentle reign.

    In every leaf, a poignant goodbye,

    A vibrant echo of the year''s sweet pain.


    Oh, autumn''s sonnet, in each leaf''s last dance,

    A vibrant farewell, in nature''s tranquil trance.'
  question: Compose a sonnet that portrays the vibrant colors of a fall foliage.
