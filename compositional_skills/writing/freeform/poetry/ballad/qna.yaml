- answer: '(Verse 1)

    In the heart of mountains, where secrets abide,

    Nature''s ballad, a tale of pride.

    Majestic peaks pierce the sky, so high,

    Guardians of stories, where eagles fly.


    (Chorus)

    Oh, the symphony of mountains, a ballad so grand,

    Whispers of ancient times in every rock and sand.

    Secrets hidden in shadows, in valleys untold,

    Nature''s ballad, a mystery to behold.


    (Verse 2)

    Glaciers carving, a sculptor''s hand,

    Shaping the mountains, as time expands.

    Cascading waterfalls, a crystal clear decree,

    Echoing tales of the mountains, for all to see.


    (Chorus)

    Oh, the symphony of mountains, a ballad so grand,

    Whispers of ancient times in every rock and sand.

    Secrets hidden in shadows, in valleys untold,

    Nature''s ballad, a mystery to behold.


    (Bridge)

    Beneath the moon''s silver and shimmering veil,

    Mountains stand tall, in the night''s quiet braille.

    Stars twinkle above, like secrets in flight,

    Nature''s ballad, a beacon of light.


    (Verse 3)

    In the silence of summits, where winds speak in codes,

    Legends of old, in the mountain''s abodes.

    Echoes of history, in every stone''s crevice,

    Nature''s ballad, a timeless device.


    (Chorus)

    Oh, the symphony of mountains, a ballad so grand,

    Whispers of ancient times in every rock and sand.

    Secrets hidden in shadows, in valleys untold,

    Nature''s ballad, a mystery to behold.


    (Outro)

    As seasons change, and winds whisper and sigh,

    The mountain''s ballad, forever to lie.

    In every snowflake, in every mountain''s crest,

    Nature''s ballad, a timeless guest.'
