- answer: 'In the waning days of summer''s reign,

    A subtle shift begins to stir.

    Nature dons her cloak of flame,

    As autumn leaves awaken to their metamorphosis.


    Crimson and gold, hues of amber,

    In every corner, a vibrant display.

    Leaves whisper tales of time,

    Of seasons turning, in their gentle way.


    Beneath the azure sky, they dance,

    A ballet of light and shadow.

    Each leaf, a fleeting sonnet,

    Penned by the hand of autumn''s glow.


    They rustle in the cool, crisp air,

    A symphony of colors bold.

    In their fiery beauty, a secret lies,

    A testament to life''s enduring hold.


    As the days grow short and cold,

    The leaves surrender to the breeze.

    In their descent, a final verse,

    A poignant ode to autumn''s ease.


    In the aftermath, a quiet stillness,

    Nature''s canvas now bereft of hue.

    Yet, in the heart of winter''s slumber,

    The promise of springtime breaks anew.'
