    ## Executive Summary


    This manual outlines the process of conducting a comprehensive security audit
    for small to medium-sized businesses. A security audit is a systematic evaluation
    of an organization''s information systems by measuring how well they conform to
    a set of established criteria. A systematic approach helps identify vulnerabilities,
    assess risks, and determine the effectiveness of current security measures.


    ## 1. Introduction

    Analyze the likelihood and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities. Consider
    factors such as:

    - Threat sources (e.g., hackers, malware, insider threats)

    - Threat vectors (e.g., network, email, social engineering)

    - Existing security controls


    ### 3.4 Step 4: Risk Analysis


    Determine the overall risk level for each vulnerability by evaluating the likelihood
    of exploitation and the potential impact on the organization.


    ### 3.5 Step 5: Control Evaluation


    Assess the effectiveness of current security controls in mitigating identified
    risks.


    ### 3.6 Step 6: Recommendations


    Provide actionable recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities and reduce
    overall risk.


    ## 4. Reporting


    ### 4.1 Document Findings


    Compile a detailed report of the audit findings, including:

    - Executive summary

    - Audit scope and methodology

    - List of identified assets

    - Summary of vulnerabilities and threats

    - Risk analysis results

    - Recommendations for improvement


    ### 4.2 Present Findings
