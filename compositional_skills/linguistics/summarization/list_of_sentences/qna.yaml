  question: "Summarize the following list of symptoms into one or two English sentences.\
    \ Do not generate any suggestion, recommendation or new symptoms.\n\nInput:\n\
    \ System load too high\nMachine is more than 50% of its time at a load higher\

    \ Consider allocating more than 4 CPU for this machine.\n\nOutput:\n"
- answer: 'Sudden increase in average latency and erroneous call rate staying at a
    high level. This is probably due to a problem in service or its downstream or
    on one side of the connection.
