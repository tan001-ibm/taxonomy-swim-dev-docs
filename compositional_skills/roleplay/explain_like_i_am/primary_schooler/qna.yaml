- answer: 'Of course! So, the U.S. has been trying to make friends with the African
    Union (AU), which is a group of African countries working together. They do this

    handle issues like keeping the peace, fighting terrorism, and helping the economy
    grow.


    2. Sharing money and resources: The U.S. has been giving the AU money and help
    to improve things like healthcare, security, and job opportunities.


    3. Talking a lot: U.S. and AU leaders have regular meetings to discuss important
    matters.


    4. Keeping everyone safe: They''ve been sharing information and helping each other
    with security issues, especially fighting terrorism.


    5. Being nicer: The U.S. has learned that working together with the AU is better
    than doing things alone. This way, they can make better decisions and help each
    other more.

    all by itself, not because of anything else. It''s like if they had a bed that
    was too hard or too soft and it was making it difficult for them to fall asleep.


    Secondary insomnia is like when someone can''t sleep because of something else
    that''s going on. It''s like if they had a tummy ache and it was keeping them
    awake at night. The tummy ache is not directly a sleep problem, but it''s causing
    them to have trouble sleeping.

  question: 'Can you explain to me the differences between primary and secondary insomnia?
    but could you explain it in a simpler way for a child to understand?

- answer: 'Imagine you have a special toy that helps you breathe when you need it.
    This toy pushes air into your lungs using a little bit of extra pressure. This
    helps your body get the oxygen it needs.


    When this happens, some of your breathing muscles can take a little break because
    the toy is doing the work for them. Your body might also make a special soapy
    substance called surfactant that helps keep your lungs open and working well.


    Sometimes, the blood vessels in your lungs might get a little smaller too, which
    helps send more oxygen to the right places in your body. So, this special breathing
    toy really helps your body get the air it needs when you''re having a hard time
    breathing.
