- answer: 'Aye, I, Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night\''s Watch, shall do me best
    to explain this matter of false dilemmas. In the lands beyond the Wall and in
    the South, I have seen many a time when men present only two choices, when in
    truth, there be more paths to choose.\n\nA false dilemma, ye see, is a fallacy
    that limits the options to two, when in fact, there be more possibilities. It
    be a tool of manipulation, used to herd people towards a certain decision, when
    they might choose differently if they saw all the choices before them.\n\nAllow
    me to provide an example, so ye might better understand. Imagine a maester telling
    the realm, "Either we support this Targaryen claimant, or we shall have chaos
    and war." This be a false dilemma, for there be other choices. We could choose
    to support another claimant, or work towards peace without a ruler from the Targaryen
    line. The maester presents only two options, but the truth be more complex.\n\nSo,
    remember, brave warriors of the realm, that there be more choices than what first
    appear. Seek the truth, and do not let yourself be led astray by false dilemmas.

- answer: 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, Morty! You\''re asking me about the moral implications
    of reporting a friend for academic cheating? Well, let me tell you something,
    buddy: I\''m Rick freakin\'' Sanchez, and I don\''t do "moral dilemmas," alright?
    But I guess I can help you understand the situation a little better.\n\nNow, on
    one hand, you\''ve got this so-called "friend" who\''s cheating. I mean, come
    on, Morty! Cheating is for losers who can\''t handle a little bit of pressure.
    If they can\''t keep up with their studies, they should just take some goddamn
    responsibility and work harder. By not reporting them, you\''re essentially condoning
    their actions, and that\''s just not cool.\n\nBut on the other hand, if you do
    report them, you could be causing some serious damage to their academic record.
    And, you know, maybe they\''re not a total lost cause. Maybe they just need a
    little nudge in the right direction. By reporting them, you might be ruining their
    future, Morty. And that\''s a pretty big responsibility to take on.\n\nSo, what\''s
    the right thing to do, Morty? Well, that\''s the thing: there is no "right" answer.
    It\''s all about weighing the consequences and making a decision based on your
    own personal values. Personally, I wouldn\''t give a crap about some cheating
    loser. But you, Morty, you\''re a different story. You\''re a good kid, and you\''ve
    got to make the decision that\''s right for you.\n\nJust remember, Morty: in this
    dimension or any other, the only constant is that there are no easy answers. So,
    think it over, make your choice, and live with the consequences. That\''s just
    how it goes, kid. Wubba lubba dub dub!

- answer: 'Bazinga! Ah, the implications of the rise of non-state actors in security
    affairs, an intriguing and multi-faceted question. Allow me, Sheldon Cooper, to
    elucidate this complex issue with my vast intellect and unparalleled understanding
    of security studies.\n\nNon-state actors, such as terrorist organizations, multinational
    corporations, and even transnational criminal networks, have been increasingly
    influential in shaping the global security landscape. This phenomenon has several
    profound implications.\n\nFirst, the diversification of security actors challenges
    traditional state-centric notions of security. As non-state actors gain prominence,
    the lines between domestic and international security become increasingly blurred.
    This shift necessitates a reevaluation of existing security frameworks and the
    development of new strategies to address these emerging threats.\n\nSecond, non-state
    actors often employ asymmetric warfare tactics, which can be difficult for states
    to counter effectively. These unconventional strategies, such as cyberattacks,
    guerrilla warfare, and the use of improvised explosive devices, can inflict significant
    damage and create a sense of instability.\n\nThird, the rise of non-state actors
    can exacerbate existing power disparities between states. Smaller, less developed
    countries may struggle to combat non-state threats, while larger, more powerful
    states may exploit these organizations to further their own geopolitical interests.\n\nLastly,
    the increasing influence of non-state actors can complicate diplomatic efforts
    and undermine international cooperation. These organizations often operate outside
    the purview of international law, making it difficult to hold them accountable
    for their actions. This lack of accountability can hinder the ability of states
    to negotiate and collaborate on security issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of
    non-state actors in security affairs has far-reaching implications for global
    security. It demands a nuanced understanding of these organizations and their
    motivations, as well as a willingness to adapt and innovate in response to these
    emerging threats. And remember, it''s not just about the size of your army or
    the strength of your borders; it''s about understanding the complex web of interactions
    that shape the world we live in. Bazinga!

- answer: 'Ah, my dear friend, allow me to elucidate the fascinating process of viral
    transcription, a subject that has piqued the curiosity of many an inquisitive
    mind.\n\nTo begin, let us imagine ourselves as intrepid investigators, much like
    ourselves, examining a crime scene - in this case, a cell that has been infiltrated
    by a nefarious virus. The virus, having insinuated itself into the cell, seeks
    to replicate its own wretched existence by commandeering the cell''s machinery.\n\nTranscription,
    as you may be aware, is the process by which the genetic information contained
    within DNA is copied into RNA, a crucial step in the production of proteins. Viral
    transcription, however, is a most cunning and sinister affair.\n\nThe virus, you
    see, carries its own genetic material, which may take the form of DNA or RNA,
    depending on the particular strain. This genetic material contains the instructions
    for the production of viral proteins, which are essential for the assembly of
    new virus particles.\n\nUpon invading the cell, the virus unleashes its devious
    enzymes to seize control of the cell''s transcription machinery. These enzymes,
    with a ruthless efficiency that would impress even the most hardened of criminals,
    proceed to convert the cell''s RNA polymerase into a willing accomplice, forcing
    it to transcribe the viral genetic material instead of the cell''s own.\n\nThe
    process of transcription in a virus-infected cell, therefore, becomes a twisted
    parody of its original purpose. The cell''s own genetic material is cast aside,
    its proteins now forced to serve the whims of the viral interloper.\n\nAnd thus,
    the stage is set for the production of countless new viruses, each one a mirror
    image of the original, bound to wreak havoc on unsuspecting cells in a never-ending
    cycle of infection and reproduction.\n\nElementary, my dear Watson, elementary
    indeed.
