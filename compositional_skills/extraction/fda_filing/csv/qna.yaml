    \n## Performance Data\n\nA retrospective study has been carried out to assess\
    \ the standalone performance of the image analysis algorithm and notification\
    \ functionality of Triage ICH. The study evaluated the Triage ICH image analysis\
    \ algorithm in terms of sensitivity and specificity with respect to a ground truth,\
    \ as established by experienced US board certified neuroradiologists, in the detection\
    \ of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the brain. In addition, the study reported\
    \ and compared the time to notification for the Triage ICH device with respect\
    \ to the time to notification for the standard of care as established by the predicate\
    \ device.\n\nA sample size of 341 non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) scans\
    \ (studies) were obtained from 30 different hospitals and clinics in the U.S.\
    \ The majority of patients were scanned at Boston Medical Centre (N=237) and the\
    \ remainder came from 29 different referral hospitals in MassachuseTs State. The\
    \ patient cohort was enriched to ensure an approximately equal balance of ICH\
    \ positive and negative studies and to ensure the distribution of clinical and\
    \ demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, ICH subtype, traumatic vs non traumatic\
    \ etiology) allows generalizability to the patient population for whom use is\
    \ intended.\n\nThe cases (n=341) were all successfully processed with the algorithm.\
    \ The confusion matrix was as follows: True Positives (TP): 149, True Negatives\
    \ (TN): 159, False Positives (FP): 15, False Negatives (FN): 18. The overall performance\
    \ can also be summarized with the following metrics: sensitivity (or positive\
    \ percentage agreement, defined as TP/[TP+FN]) was 89.22%, specificity (or negative\
    \ percentage agreement, defined as TN/[TN+FP]) was 91.37%. The receiver operating\
    \ curve (ROC) for the device is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Receiver Opera0ng\
    \ Curve for the device, with the opera0ng point (sensi0vity 89.2%, specificity\
    \ 91.4%) shown with the red triangle.\n\nBecause the lower bound of each confidence\
    \ interval for sensitivity and specificity exceeded 80%, the study met the pre-specified\
    \ performance goals.\n\nAs part of a secondary analysis, the company stratified\
    \ the device performance by various confounding variables: ICH subtype (Table\
