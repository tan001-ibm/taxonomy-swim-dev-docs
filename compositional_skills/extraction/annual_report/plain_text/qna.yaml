    \nOur business profile positions us well in challenging times. Our diversification\

    \ in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating\
    \ labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have\
    \ put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we\
    \ have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which\
    \ makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost\
    \ inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements\
    \ year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which\
    \ will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin\
    \ of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved\
    \ 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting\
    \ the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based\
    \ businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases\
    \ to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due\
    \ to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance\
    \ and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally,\
    \ despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply\
    \ chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to\
    \ potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening\
    \ of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in\
