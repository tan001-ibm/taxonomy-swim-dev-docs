    Kate Soule\n\nHi Kate,\n\nI am writing to explain to you the delay in our lab\
    \ receiving monitors. On Dec 2$^{nd,}$ 2023, I started the process of purchasing\
    \ 7 high-def Samsung monitors for the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. I think you already\
    \ know, but I wanted to outline the steps needed to make this purchase.\n\n1.\
    \ Obtain a quote from Samsung\n\n2. Submit an Expense Pre-Approval\n\n3. Approval\
    \ from Line VP\n\n4. Submit an Ad Hoc request to Procurement\n\n5. Approval from\
    \ Manager\n\n6. Approval from 2$^{nd}$ line Manager\n\n7. Approval from Finance\n\
    \n8. Procurement then identifies their specialist for this request\n\n9. The Procurement\
    \ specialist then reviews the request and determines which supplier to use and\
    \ reaches out to the contact person there\n\n10. These two finalize agreements\
    \ needed to execute the order\n\n11. Monitors are then shipped to our location\n\
    \nWe have now finally reached number 11 in this process. Below I wanted to outline\
    \ what we are receiving and when they are expected to arrive.\n\n| Monitor\_\_\

    \ that 5/10/2024 was actually 10/5/2024.\n\nI apologize for the confusion.\n\n\
