  question: 'What is the total price of the entire order?

    '
- answer: 'To determine how many days remain for all items to be delivered, we need
    to know the current date, and the delivery date for the final item. The number
    of days in between these two dates will be the days remaining for all items to
    be delivered.


    The current date of the email is February 23, 2024. The delivery date for the
    final item is May 10, 2024. There are 77 days in-between February 23 and May 10,
    which means it will take a total of 77 days for all items to be delivered to the
    MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.

    \ each. \n\nTo determine how many additional Odyssey G55C 27-Inch monitors could\
    \ be afforded if the Odyssey Ark-55-Inch was cancelled, we need to divide the\
    \ price of the Odyssey Ark-55-Inch by the price of the Odyssey G55C 27-Inch monitors.\
    \ 1,952 divided by 297 is 6.57. \n\nThis means 6 additional Odyssey G55C 27-Inch\
