      15.8 Force Majeure Neither party will be in default or liable for any
      delay or failure to comply with this Agreement due to any act beyond the
      control of the affected party, excluding labor disputes, provided such
      party immediately notifies the other. 
    question: >
      Force majeure is a clause that is included in contracts to remove
      liability for unforeseeable and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt
      the expected course of events and prevent participants from fulfilling
      obligations. These clauses generally cover natural disasters, such as
      hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes, as well as human actions, such as
      armed conflict and human-made diseases. For each text, answer yes if it
      conveys force majeure. Keep your response short.
  - answer: 'Yes'
    context: >-
      Notwithstanding the above, a strike or slow obstructive or disruptive
      conduct of work by Supplier Personnel or Subcontractor's personnel which
      is caused by unlawful act or omission of the Supplier shall not be deemed
      to be circumstances outside the control of the supplier In the event of
      any Force Majeure occurrence, the Party claiming to be affected thereby
      shall immediately notify the other Party, giving full particulars thereof,
      and shall use its best endeavors to remedy such failure of fulfillment
      with all reasonable dispatch Either Party shall have the right, during any
      period of Force Majeure, to mitigate its losses arising from the effects
      of Force Majeure always provided that, upon cessation of the Force
      Majeure, the affected Party shall immediately resume its obligations under
      the Agreement and relevant SOW. Such affected Party shall continue to keep
      the other Party fully advised of the progress being made in such efforts.
      Under no circumstances shall the relevant SOW Price be increased to
      include for the financial impact on either Party of any Force Majeure
      occurrence 
    question: >-
      Force majeure in a contract ensures that parties have no liability for
      failing to fulfill their obligations in a catastrophic or unforseen event
      outside their control.  Does the following text convey a force majeure ? 
  - answer: 'Yes'
    context: >-
      Neither party shall be responsible for, and shall not be liable to the
      other party for, any loss, damage, delay or failure of performance
      resulting directly or indirectly from any event or circumstance or
      combination of any event or circumstance that is beyond their reasonable
      control ("Force Majeure") including, but not limited to, any: (i) delay in
      obtaining or failure to obtain or renew any permit or governmental
      authorization after using best efforts to obtain or renew such permits or
      authorizations, (ii) act of God or of the public enemy, (iii) action, or
      failure to act, of any governmental authority, (iv) war or warlike
      operations, (v) civil war or commotion, mobilization, military call-up and

      restriction, earthquake, landslide or other natural event, (viii) freight
      embargo, (ix) unworkable weather, (xi) act or omission of transporters,
      provided such party immediately notifies the other of such Force Majeure
      event or circumstance. 
    question: >
      In contract law, force majeure clauses are included to explicitly agree
      that contractual parties are not liable for failing to fulfill their
      obligations in catastrophic circumstances that are outside their control,
      such as earthquakes and other severe natural events, or armed conflict.
      Does the following paragraph suggest a force majeure clause?
  - answer: 'Yes'

      law without the possibility of contractual waiver; g. failure by either of
      us to insist on strict performance or to exercise a right when entitled
      does not prevent either of us from doing so at a later time, either in

      responsible for failure to fulfil obligations due to causes beyond the
      control of either of us; i. neither of us may assign this Agreement, in

      Force majeure is a clause included in contracts to relieve parties from

      Rights and Remedies of CSU for Default (a) In the event any Deliverables
      furnished or services provided by the Contractor in the performance of
      this Contract should fail to conform to the requirements herein, or to the
      sample submitted by the Contractor, the CSU may reject the same, and it
      shall thereupon become the duty of the Contractor to reclaim and remove
      the same forthwith or to correct the performance of services, without
      expense to the CSU, and immediately to replace all such rejected items
      with others conforming to such specifications or samples; provided that
      should the Contractor fail, neglect, or refuse to do so, the CSU shall
      thereupon have the right to purchase in the open market, in lieu thereof,
      a corresponding quantity of any such items and to deduct from any moneys
      due or that may thereafter become due to the Contractor the difference
      between the price named in the Contract and the actual cost thereof to the
      CSU. (b) In the event the Contractor shall fail to make prompt delivery as
      specified of any item, the same conditions as to the right of the CSU to
      purchase in the open market and to reimbursement set forth above shall
      apply, except for force majeure. Except for defaults of subcontractors,
      neither party shall be responsible for delays or failures in performance
      resulting from acts beyond the control of the offending party. Such acts
      (known as "force majeure") shall include but shall not be limited to fire,
      strike, freight embargo or acts of God and of the Government. If a delay
      or failure in performance by the Contractor arises out of a default of its
      subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the control
      of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or
      negligence of either of them, the Contractor shall not be liable for
      damages of such delay or failure, unless the supplies or services to be
      furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in
      sufficient time to permit the Contractor to meet the required performance
      schedule. (c) In the event of the termination of the Contract, either in
      whole or in part, by reason of the default or breach thereof by the
      Contractor, any loss or damage sustained by the CSU in procuring any items
      which the Contractor therein agreed to supply shall be borne and paid for
      by the Contractor. (d) The rights and remedies of the CSU provided above
      shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and
      remedies provided by law or under the Contract.
