- answer: 'To calculate the three-month moving average (SMA), we need to take the
    average of sales figures for the past three months and then use it to forecast
    sales for the next month. Here''s how to calculate the SMA:

    - January: Not enough data for SMA calculation

    - February: Not enough data for SMA calculation

    - March: (1000 + 1100 + 1050) / 3 = 1050

    - April: (1100 + 1050 + 1200) / 3 = 1116.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

    - May: (1050 + 1200 + 1250) / 3 = 1166.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

    Therefore, the three-month moving average sales forecast for the next three months
    would be:

    - June: $1116.67

    - July: $1166.67

    - August: $1216.67

  question: 'Question:

    You are analyzing sales data for a retail store over the past year. The sales
    data is recorded monthly, and you want to forecast sales for the next three months
    using a simple moving average (SMA) model. The sales figures for the past 12 months
    are as follows:

    Month: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
    November, December

    Sales: 1000, 1100, 1050, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1550, 1650, 1700
    (in USD)

    Calculate the three-month moving average for sales and use it to forecast sales
    for the next three months.

- answer: 'To calculate the six-month weighted moving average (WMA), we need to multiply
    each sales figure by its corresponding weight, sum up the weighted values, and
    divide by the sum of the weights. Here''s how to calculate the WMA:

    - January: Not enough data for WMA calculation

    - February: Not enough data for WMA calculation

    - March: Not enough data for WMA calculation

    - April: (1200 \* 0.5 + 1050 \* 0.3 + 1100 \* 0.2) / (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) = 1165

    - May: (1250 \* 0.5 + 1200 \* 0.3 + 1050 \* 0.2) / (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) = 1205

    - June: (1300 \* 0.5 + 1250 \* 0.3 + 1200 \* 0.2) / (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) = 1255

    Therefore, the six-month weighted moving average sales forecast for the next six
    months would be:

    - July: $1215

    - August: $1265

    - September: $1315

    - October: $1365

    - November: $1415

    - December: $1465

  question: 'You are tasked with forecasting sales for the next six months using a
    weighted moving average (WMA) model. You decide to assign weights of 0.5, 0.3,
    and 0.2 to the sales figures from the three most recent months, respectively.
    Using the same sales data  calculate the six-month weighted moving average for
    sales and use it to forecast sales for the next six months.


    Month: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
    November, December


    Sales: 1000, 1100, 1050, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1550, 1650, 1700

- answer: "To calculate the exponential smoothing forecast, we start with the initial\
    \ forecast for the first month, which is equal to the actual sales figure for\
    \ the first month. Then, for each subsequent month, we update the forecast using\
    \ the smoothing factor (\u03B1) and the difference between the actual sales figure\
    \ and the previous forecast. Here's how to calculate the exponential smoothing\
    \ forecast:\n- Initial forecast for January = Actual sales for January = $1000\n\
    - Forecast for February:\n- Forecast for February = (\u03B1 \\* Actual sales for\
    \ February) + ((1 - \u03B1) \\* Forecast for January)\n- = (0.3 \\* $1100) + (0.7\
    \ \\* $1000)\n- = $330 + $700\n- = $1030\n- Forecast for March:\n- Forecast for\
    \ March = (\u03B1 \\* Actual sales for March) + ((1 - \u03B1) \\* Forecast for\
    \ February)\n- = (0.3 \\* $1050) + (0.7 \\* $1030)\n- = $315 + $721\n- = $1036\n\
    Therefore, the exponential smoothing forecast for sales for the next three months\
    \ would be:\n- February: $1030\n- March: $1036\n- April: $1040.8 (rounded to 1\
    \ decimal place)\n\n"
