- answer: "Solution: We know,\nCircumference of circle = 2\u03C0r = 2 x (22/7) x 21\
    \ = 2 x 22 x 3 = 132 cm\nArea of circle = \u03C0r2\_= (22/7) x 212\_= 22/7 x 21\
    \ x 21 = 22 x 3 x 21\nArea of circle with radius, 21cm = 1386 cm2\n"
  question: "A circle has a radius of 21 cm. Find its circumference and area. (Use\
    \ \u03C0 = 22/7)\n"
- answer: "Solution: Given,\nDiagonal, d = 10 cm\nHeight of one triangle, h1\_= 4cm\n\
    Height of another triangle, h2\_= 6cm\nArea of quadrilateral = \xBD d(h1+h2) =\
    \ \xBD x 10 x (4+6) = 5 x 10 = 50 sq.cm.\n"
  question: Suppose a quadrilateral having a diagonal of length 10 cm, which divides
    the quadrilateral into two triangles and the heights of triangles with diagonals
    as the base, are 4 cm and 6 cm. Find the area of the quadrilateral.
- answer: "Solution: One of the parallel sides of the trapezium is a = 20 m, let another\
    \ parallel side be b, height h = 15 m.\nThe given area of trapezium = 480 m2\n\
    We know, by formula;\nArea of a trapezium = \xBD h (a+b)\n480 = \xBD (15) (20+b)\n\
    20 + b = (480\xD72)/15\nb = 64 \u2013 20 = 44 m\n"
  question: 'The area of a trapezium shaped field is 480 m2, the distance between
    two parallel sides is 15 m and one of the parallel sides is 20 m. Find the other
    parallel side.
