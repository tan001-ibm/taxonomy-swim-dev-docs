- answer: 'In order to find the answer you can subtract the first number from the
    last from the last number of the last, and then add one back in (because you start
    counting at zero, not one) to get the final answer.  So 151 - 25 + = 127.

  question: 'How many numbers are in the list 25, 26, ..., 151?

- answer: 'If 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps then 42 baps \* 5/3 yaps/baps \*
    4/7 daps/yaps = 40 daps.

  question: 'If 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps,

    how many daps equal 42 baps?'
- answer: "(A) 9.8 m/s\xB2 --  This is because even though you threw the ball the\
    \ second time, it will leave your hand with a higher initial velocity, but it\
    \ will still only accelerate at the same constant rate due to gravitational pull\
    \ until terminal velocity is reached.\n"
  question: "When you drop a ball from rest it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s\xB2\
    . If you instead throw it\ndownward assuming no air resistance its acceleration\
    \ immediately after leaving your hand is\n(A) 9.8 m/s\xB2\n(B) more than 9.8 m/s\xB2\
    \n(C) less than 9.8 m/s\xB2\n(D) Cannot say unless the speed of throw is given.\n"
